## My process

1. I started with the markup on index.html, complying with HTML5 semantic tags and standards as much as possible.
2. The styling provided by the project briefing was implemented first, followed by the classes I came up with on the
   markup.
3. I used Figma to acquire all the right dimensions involved in the layout and implemented them in the appropriate CSS
   classes.
4. The [CSS Cube](https://cube.fyi/) methodology was used when coding the stylesheet.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Cube CSS methodology
